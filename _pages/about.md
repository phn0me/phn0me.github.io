# What's all this about?

It’s about me, **Simon** (or ```phn0me``` – which is Simon typed out on T9 and my first WoW character was a gnome).

I’m an IT professional with over 10 years of experience in the tech industry. Along the way, I've had the privilege of working with some incredibly smart and talented people. My career has been diverse, spanning across IT support, systems administration, IT consulting, and more recently, IT security and penetration testing.

### My Career Path

- **Support Engineer**: I kicked things off as a support engineer at a large Swedish retailer, troubleshooting technical issues and helping users solve problems quickly and efficiently.

- **Systems Administrator**: From there, I transitioned into a systems administration role, where I took on the responsibility of maintaining and optimizing IT infrastructure. There was also some network infrastructure work sprinkled in to keep things running smoothly.

- **Head of IT Support**: In this leadership role, I managed a team of IT professionals, ensuring fast and reliable support, improving workflows, and keeping systems secure and operational for the business.

- **IT Consultant**: As an IT consultant for an ERP systems developer, I worked closely with clients to integrate and customize systems, troubleshoot issues, and streamline their business processes.

- **Programming & Scripting**: Over the years, I’ve picked up programming and scripting skills, automating repetitive tasks, developing internal tools, and improving productivity.

### Pivot to IT Security

About a year ago, I made the shift into **IT security**, diving into the **Red/Blue (Purple) teaming** side of things and exploring **bug bounty hunting**. This transition has been one of the most exciting changes in my career.

#### Why?

Well, it all started with years of listening to the *[Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com)* podcast and being directly involved in a major security incident a few Christmases ago. Those experiences made me realize that IT security was something I had to get serious about.

So, I dove in—reading, listening, watching, and applying everything I could to help protect assets and systems. It didn’t take long for me to realize that this was the path I wanted to follow.

Along the way, I've had the privilege of learning from some of the best in the industry, and I want to shout out a few people who’ve inspired me:

- **[David Jacoby](https://x.com/JacobyDavid)** – One of the most knowledgeable and inspiring people I’ve had the pleasure of working with. A true security expert.
- **[Jason Haddix](https://x.com/Jhaddix)** – A wealth of knowledge in CISO work, hacking, and security talks. He’s one of my all-time favorites and a major influence.
- **[Nahamsec](https://x.com/NahamSec)** – Taught me a ton, without even knowing it. He’s a legendary bug bounty hunter and offers a ton of free content that helped shape my journey.
- **[Stök](https://x.com/stokfredrik)** – The one who got me into bug bounty hunting, again, without even knowing it. His YouTube content and track record in security are a huge source of inspiration.

These folks are just a few of the many great resources out there—if you’re into security, give them a follow and dive into the wealth of knowledge they share!

### Outside of Work

When I’m not deep into the world of IT security, I enjoy spending time with my kids, staying active, and working on my **2D game engine** in **Rust**. It’s a fun side project that keeps me learning and experimenting with new tech.
