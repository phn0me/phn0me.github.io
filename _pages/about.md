# What's all this about?

It's about me, __Simon__ or ```phn0me``` (which is Simon typed out on T9 with an additional e).

I'm a IT professional with over 10 years of experience in the industry. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work with some incredibly talented people and grow my skill set across a variety of domains. From systems administration to IT consulting, I've always been driven by the challenge of solving complex problems and improving systems.

### My Career Journey

- **Systems Administrator**: I started my career managing and maintaining IT infrastructure, ensuring systems ran smoothly and efficiently.
- **Head of IT Support**: As the head of IT support, I led a team dedicated to troubleshooting, resolving technical issues, and providing exceptional service across the organization.
- **IT Consultant for ERP Developer**: I worked as an IT consultant for an ERP developer, where I gained experience in system integration, troubleshooting, and customizing solutions for clients.
- **Programming and Scripting**: Along the way, I picked up programming and scripting skills, automating tasks and enhancing workflows.

### Transition to IT Security

About a year ago, I pivoted into the world of **IT security**, focusing on **penetration testing** and **bug bounty hunting**. This transition has been incredibly exciting, as it allows me to use my problem-solving skills in new and creative ways while working to keep systems and data safe from emerging threats.

### Outside of Work

When I'm not immersed in technology, I enjoy spending quality time with my children, which keeps me grounded and inspired. I'm also passionate about game development and am currently working on a **2D game engine** in **Rust** during my spare time. It's a fun and challenging project that allows me to explore new concepts and improve my coding skills.
