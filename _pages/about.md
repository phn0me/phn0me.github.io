title: "What's all this About?"
---

It’s about me, **Simon** (or `phn0me`—the result of typing 'Simon' on a T9 keypad, with the 'e' added because my first WoW character was a gnome).

I’m an IT professional with over 10 years of experience in the tech industry. Along the way, I’ve had the privilege of working with some incredibly talented individuals. My career has spanned IT support, systems administration, IT consulting, and more recently, IT security and penetration testing.

### My Career Path

- **Support Engineer**: I began my career as a support engineer at a large Swedish retailer, troubleshooting technical issues and providing quick, efficient solutions to users.

- **Systems Administrator**: I transitioned into a systems administration role, where I took on responsibility for maintaining and optimizing IT infrastructure, with some network infrastructure work to ensure everything ran smoothly.

- **Head of IT Support**: In this leadership position, I managed a team of IT professionals, ensuring fast and reliable support, improving workflows, and maintaining secure, operational systems for the business.

- **IT Consultant**: As an IT consultant for an ERP systems developer, I collaborated closely with clients to integrate and customize systems, troubleshoot issues, and optimize business processes.

- **Programming & Scripting**: Over the years, I’ve developed programming and scripting skills, automating repetitive tasks, creating internal tools, and enhancing productivity.

### Pivot to IT Security

About a year ago, I transitioned into **IT security**, focusing on **Red/Blue (Purple) teaming** and exploring **bug bounty hunting**. This shift has been one of the most exciting changes in my career.

#### Why?

It all started with years of listening to the *[Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com)* podcast, combined with my involvement in a major security incident a few Christmases ago. These experiences made me realize that IT security was something I had to take seriously.

I dove in—reading, listening, watching, and applying everything I could to protect systems and assets. It didn’t take long to realize this was the path I wanted to follow.

Along the way, I've had the privilege of learning from some of the best in the industry. Here are a few people who've inspired me:

- **[David Jacoby](https://x.com/JacobyDavid)** – One of the most knowledgeable and inspiring people I’ve worked with. A true security expert.
- **[Jason Haddix](https://x.com/Jhaddix)** – A wealth of knowledge in CISO work, hacking, and security talks. He’s a major influence and one of my all-time favorites.
- **[Nahamsec](https://x.com/NahamSec)** – A legendary bug bounty hunter who’s taught me a ton (without even knowing it). His free content has been a huge help in shaping my journey.
- **[Stök](https://x.com/stokfredrik)** – The person who introduced me to bug bounty hunting (again, without even knowing it). His YouTube content and security expertise continue to inspire me.

These are just a few of the many fantastic resources out there—if you’re into security, be sure to follow them and dive into the wealth of knowledge they share!

### Outside of Work

When I’m not immersed in IT security, I enjoy spending time with my kids, staying active, and working on my **2D game engine** in **Rust**. It’s a fun side project that allows me to continue learning and experimenting with new technologies.
